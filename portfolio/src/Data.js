As UX Lead, I defined the UX vision and end-to-end UX architecture for the AlinIQ Analytics platform of products. I spearheaded the creation of the DHS (Digital Health Solutions) design system by managing contractors and providing design direction and governance. Working with other junior designers and several product teams, the DHS UX team created wireframes and workflows for new features and assured consistency with design patterns within the Abbott DHS design system as well as aligned features with user needs discovered in initial research and interviews with subject matter experts",

Research consisted of interviews with subject matter experts within the organization and secondary research to look into what lab person does on a day-to-day basis, their top priorities, and goals. With the insights gained, I created a comprehensive ‘service design’ customer journey with included hardware and software. I then built out a high level UX architecture for the Platform administration, how a lab should be setup, and what type of widgets should be included in the MVP for the dashboard view.",

With a comprehensive and efficient governance process in place with the contractors, I was able to work closely with the product team and focus on UX direction and architecture based off of user needs and business requirements, and provide engineering teams with wireframes and final UI designs.",

If a pattern currently existed in our design system, I’d follow the specs and usage to determine the UI direction. However; if a pattern did not exist I’d help define the direction, look and feel, and standards for that feature. For example, this redesign of road segments was based off of country traffic definition standards and accessibility standards. Once these were properly vetted, they were added to the HERE LUI design system as standards for all HERE map products to assure consistency and cohesion. ",
