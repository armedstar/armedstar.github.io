As UX Lead, I defined the UX vision and end-to-end UX architecture for the AlinIQ Analytics platform of products. I spearheaded the creation of the DHS (Digital Health Solutions) design system by managing contractors and providing design direction and governance. Working with other junior designers and several product teams, the DHS UX team created wireframes and workflows for new features and assured consistency with design patterns within the design system as well as aligned features with user needs and business directives discovered in initial user and market research phase",

Research consisted of interviews with subject matter experts within the organization and secondary research to look into the day-to-day duties of lab personelle, their top priorities, goals and pain points. With the insights gained, I created a comprehensive ‘service design’ customer journey which included hardware and software touch points. I then built out a high level UX architecture for the Platform administration, which included Abbott service setting up accounts for the customer, the customer administrator setting up their lab, and what type of widgets should be included in the MVP for the dashboard view for the AlinIQ Insights main page.",

If a pattern currently existed in our design system, I’d follow the specs and usage to determine the UI direction. However; if a pattern did not exist I’d help define the direction, look and feel, and standards for that feature. For example, this redesign of road segments was based off of country traffic definitions and accessibility standards. Once these were properly vetted, they were added to the HERE LUI design system as standards for all HERE map products to assure consistency and cohesion.",
